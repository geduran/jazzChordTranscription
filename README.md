Code for Master Thesis
==============================

Master Thesis on Automatic Chord Transcription for Jazz music.

On **Src/** there are generic tools for audio and MIDI processing. There is a
subdir for bass onset detection stage, one for Jazz chorus segments synchronization
and another for Jazz chord transcription.

**data/** dir is not in the repo for practical reasons, so the codes can't be executed as they are found here.
